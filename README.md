# Schaltungssimulator (Circuit Simulator)
A simple tool for building and simulating simple circuits built with HTML+CSS+JavaScript for a school project.\
The app does not have an English translation at the moment, but will likely be added at some point.
# Why should you use this app?

This app is designed to be very simple. While it does have some nice features, it is a very simplified simulator and you can't expect a school project to have sufficient features for a professional simulator. **I could however recommend this to teachers and students.** Since the app is designed with simplicity in mind, I believe it could serve its purpose well as a teaching tool.
