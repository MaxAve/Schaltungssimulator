# Schaltungssimulator (Circuit Simulator)
A simple tool for building and simulating simple circuits built with HTML+CSS+JavaScript for a school project.\
The app does not have an English translation at the moment, but will likely be added at some point.
# Why should you use this app?
![alt text](assets/neat_meme.jpg "Title")\
The app is designed with simplicity in mind (Translation: I hate javascript; I would *almost* rather use windows for the rest of my life than code in javascript; please dont make me come back to this project ever again), meaning it lacks a lot of features that you would need to actually design small circuits. It would work in a school setting I suppose, but I would discourage anyone to use it anywhere else.
